# Example Puppet Hardening

Demonstrates the use of hardening modules via puppet. Use either Vagrant or Docker, whichever you prefer.


## Vagrant

You will require `librarian-puppet` for module resolution:

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-puppet

Now clone this repo and get your box up.

    vagrant up ubuntu-trusty

That's it. Enjoy testing your box via:

    vagrant ssh ubuntu-trusty
